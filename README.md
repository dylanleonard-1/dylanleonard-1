### ⚙️ What It Does
- ✅ Simulates third-party vulnerability injects w/ CVEs, patch gaps, exposure risks
- 🧠 Built-in logic for duplicate entries, missing contacts, outdated patches, SLA violations
- 🧮 Excel + DAX practice built-in: escalation tagging, conditional formatting, VLOOKUPs
- 📊 Power BI dashboards for region risk, SLA timelines, vendor heatmaps
- 📡 Splunk + SOAR integration for log simulation + alerting

### 🎯 Who It’s For
SOC analysts, vendor risk managers, red teamers, and anyone training for GRC tools like **ProcessUnity**, **ServiceNow VRM**, or **OneTrust**.

### 📽️ Live Demo (Coming Soon)
